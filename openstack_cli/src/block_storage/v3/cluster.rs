/// Clusters (clusters)
///
/// Administrator only. Lists all Cinder clusters, show cluster detail, enable or disable a
/// cluster.
///
/// Each cinder service runs on a host computer (possibly multiple services on the same host; it
/// depends how you decide to deploy cinder). In order to support High Availability scenarios,
/// services can be grouped into clusters where the same type of service (for example,
/// cinder-volume) can run on different hosts so that if one host goes down the service is still
/// available on a different host. Since there’s no point having these services sitting around
/// doing nothing while waiting for some other host to go down (which is also known as
/// Active/Passive mode), grouping services into clusters also allows cinder to support
/// Active/Active mode in which all services in a cluster are doing work all the time.
///
///
/// **Note**: Currently the only service that can be grouped into clusters is cinder-volume.
///
/// Clusters are determined by the deployment configuration; that’s why there is no
/// ‘create-cluster’ API call listed below. Once your services are up and running, however, you can
/// use the following API requests to get information about your clusters and to update their
/// status.
