/// Set the state of members for a pool in one API call. This may include
/// creating new members, deleting old members, and updating existing members.
/// Existing members are matched based on address/port combination.
///
/// For example, assume a pool currently has two members. These members have
/// the following address/port combinations: ‘192.0.2.15:80’ and
/// ‘192.0.2.16:80’. Now assume a PUT request is made that includes members
/// with address/port combinations: ‘192.0.2.16:80’ and ‘192.0.2.17:80’.
///
/// The member ‘192.0.2.15:80’ will be deleted, because it was not in the
/// request.
///
/// The member ‘192.0.2.16:80’ will be updated to match the request data for
/// that member, because it was matched.
///
/// The member ‘192.0.2.17:80’ will be created, because no such member existed.
///
/// The optional parameter `additive_only` when defined as `true` will skip
/// deletions for members missing from the provided list. If this were set in
/// the above example, the member ‘192.0.2.15:80’ would have remained in the
/// pool.
///
/// If the request is valid, the service returns the `Accepted (202)` response
/// code. To confirm the updates, check that the member provisioning statuses
/// are `ACTIVE` for new or updated members, and that any unspecified members
/// were correctly deleted. If the statuses are `PENDING_UPDATE` or
/// `PENDING_DELETE`, use GET to poll the member objects for changes.
