/// Lists public virtual machine (VM) images. *(Since Image API v2.0)*
///
/// **Pagination**
///
/// Returns a subset of the larger collection of images and a link that you can
/// use to get the next set of images. You should always check for the presence
/// of a `next` link and use it as the URI in a subsequent HTTP GET request.
/// You should follow this pattern until a `next` link is no longer provided.
///
/// The `next` link preserves any query parameters that you send in your
/// initial request. You can use the `first` link to jump back to the first
/// page of the collection. If you prefer to paginate through images manually,
/// use the `limit` and `marker` parameters.
///
/// **Query Filters**
///
/// The list operation accepts query parameters to filter the response.
///
/// A client can provide direct comparison filters by using most image
/// attributes, such as `name=Ubuntu`, `visibility=public`, and so on.
///
/// To filter using image tags, use the filter `tag` (note the singular). To
/// filter on multiple tags, include each tag separately in the query. For
/// example, to find images with the tag **ready**, include `tag=ready` in your
/// query string. To find images tagged with **ready** and **approved**,
/// include `tag=ready&tag=approved` in your query string. (Note that only
/// images containing *both* tags will be included in the response.)
///
/// A client cannot use any `link` in the json-schema, such as self, file, or
/// schema, to filter the response.
///
/// You can list VM images that have a status of `active`, `queued`, or
/// `saving`.
///
/// **The** `in` **Operator**
///
/// As a convenience, you may specify several values for any of the following
/// fields by using the `in` operator:
///
/// For most of these, usage is straight forward. For example, to list images
/// in queued or saving status, use:
///
/// `GET /v2/images?status=in:saving,queued`
///
/// To find images in a particular list of image IDs, use:
///
/// `GET /v2/images?id=in:3afb79c1-131a-4c38-a87c-bc4b801d14e6,2e011209-660f-44b5-baf2-2eb4babae53d`
///
/// Using the `in` operator with the `name` property of images can be a bit
/// trickier, depending upon how creatively you have named your images. The
/// general rule is that if an image name contains a comma (`,`), you must
/// enclose the entire name in quotation marks (`"`). As usual, you must URL
/// encode any characters that require it.
///
/// For example, to find images named `glass, darkly` or `share me`, you would
/// use the following filter specification:
///
/// `GET v2/images?name=in:"glass,%20darkly",share%20me`
///
/// As with regular filtering by name, you must specify the complete name you
/// are looking for. Thus, for example, the query string `name=in:glass,share`
/// will only match images with the exact name `glass` or the exact name
/// `share`. It will not find an image named `glass, darkly` or an image named
/// `share me`.
///
/// **Size Comparison Filters**
///
/// You can use the `size_min` and `size_max` query parameters to filter images
/// that are greater than or less than the image size. The size, in bytes, is
/// the size of an image on disk.
///
/// For example, to filter the container to include only images that are from 1
/// to 4 MB, set the `size_min` query parameter to `1048576` and the `size_max`
/// query parameter to `4194304`.
///
/// **Time Comparison Filters**
///
/// You can use a *comparison operator* along with the `created_at` or
/// `updated_at` fields to filter your results. Specify the operator first, a
/// colon (`:`) as a separator, and then the time in
/// [ISO 8601 Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). Available
/// comparison operators are:
///
/// For example:
///
/// **Sorting**
///
/// You can use query parameters to sort the results of this operation.
///
/// To sort the response, use the `sort_key` and `sort_dir` query parameters:
///
/// Alternatively, specify the `sort` query parameter:
///
/// Normal response codes: 200
///
/// Error response codes: 400, 401, 403
