    /// *Pagination*
    ///
    /// Returns a subset of the larger collection of images and a link that you
    /// can use to get the next set of images. You should always check for the
    /// presence of a next link and use it as the URI in a subsequent HTTP GET
    /// request. You should follow this pattern until a next link is no longer
    /// provided.
    ///
    /// The next link preserves any query parameters that you send in your
    /// initial request. You can use the first link to jump back to the first
    /// page of the collection. If you prefer to paginate through images
    /// manually, use the limit and marker parameters.
    ///
    /// *Query Filters*
    ///
    /// The list operation accepts query parameters to filter the response.
    ///
    /// A client can provide direct comparison filters by using most image
    /// attributes, such as name=Ubuntu, visibility=public, and so on.
    ///
    /// To filter using image tags, use the filter tag (note the singular). To
    /// filter on multiple tags, include each tag separately in the query. For
    /// example, to find images with the tag ready, include tag=ready in your
    /// query string. To find images tagged with ready and approved, include
    /// tag=ready&tag=approved in your query string. (Note that only images
    /// containing both tags will be included in the response.)
    ///
    /// A client cannot use any link in the json-schema, such as self, file, or
    /// schema, to filter the response.
    ///
    /// You can list VM images that have a status of active, queued, or saving.
    ///
    /// *The `in` Operator*
    ///
    /// As a convenience, you may specify several values for any of the
    /// following fields by using the in operator: [container_format,
    /// disk_format, id, name, status]
    ///
    /// For most of these, usage is straight forward. For example, to list
    /// images in queued or saving status, use: `--status "in:saving,queued"`
    ///
    /// To find images in a particular list of image IDs, use: `--id
    /// "in:3afb79c1-131a-4c38-a87c-bc4b801d14e6,2e011209-660f-44b5-baf2-2eb4babae53d"
    ///
    /// Using the in operator with the name property of images can be a bit
    /// trickier, depending upon how creatively you have named your images. The
    /// general rule is that if an image name contains a comma (,), you must
    /// enclose the entire name in quotation marks ("). As usual, you must URL
    /// encode any characters that require it.
    ///
    /// For example, to find images named glass, darkly or share me, you would
    /// use the following filter specification: `--name:
    /// 'in:"glass,%20darkly",share%20me'`
    ///
    /// As with regular filtering by name, you must specify the complete name
    /// you are looking for. Thus, for example, the query `--name
    /// "in:glass,share"` will only match images with the exact name glass or
    /// the exact name share. It will not find an image named glass, darkly or
    /// an image named share me.
    ///
    /// *Size Comparison Filters*
    ///
    /// You can use the size_min and size_max query parameters to filter images
    /// that are greater than or less than the image size. The size, in bytes,
    /// is the size of an image on disk.
    ///
    /// For example, to filter the container to include only images that are
    /// from 1 to 4 MB, set the size_min query parameter to 1048576 and the
    /// size_max query parameter to 4194304.
    ///
    /// *Time Comparison Filters*
    ///
    /// You can use a comparison operator along with the created_at or
    /// updated_at fields to filter your results. Specify the operator first, a
    /// colon (:) as a separator, and then the time in ISO 8601 Format.
    /// Available comparison operators are: [gt, gte, eq, neq, lt, lte]
