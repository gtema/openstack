# Compute Servers

A `Servers` view lists all servers in the current project. Few additional
filters are available (i.e. `all_domains`).

Currently it is possible also to list all instance actions performed on the
selected entry (by pressing `<a>` on the selected entry) as well as for the
selected instance actions list related events (by pressing `<e>`).
