# Identity Users

By default all users in the current domain are shown. When using admin
connection this may differ, but in general results are equal to invocation of
the CLI for the current connection.

The view gives possibility to enable/disable current selected user as well as
list user application credentials. More possibilities are going to be added in
the future (i.e. changing user password, deletion, e-mail update, etc)
