# Contributing

Thank you so much for having interesting in contributing to the project.

## Issues reporting

- crashes, panics and such should be reported there directly. Code should not
  crash, it is a bug.

- missing or wrong arguments, errors with response, etc are most likely caused
  by wrong OpenAPI schemas. please report here, but do not start working on
  addressing those since they need to be fixed either in codegenerator or in the
  service itself.

- missing commands in the CLI are most likely not enabled yet (generated by the
  codegenerator, but not included/imported yet as modules). Please report an
  issue or propose PR including generated modules in the source code.

## Code Generation

Most parts of the code are automatically generated by
<https://opendev.org/openstack/codegenerator> and therefore direct changes to
the generated code are not making sense. Instead the codegenerator should be
adapted where necessary. This approach forces code to be consistent.

All generated modules have a corresponding notice in the header.

if you have an idea how generated code can be improved open an issue or discussion.

## Rust design decisions:

- If a function needs to take ownership of the data, pass by value

- If a function only needs to read the data, pass a reference (borrow)

- If a function needs to change the data, pass a mutable reference.

## Linters and co

- pre-commit is present in the repository to help ensuring linters will not
  complain later. just issue `pre-commit install` in the repository root to
  enable it.

- spell checking is performed using 'crate-ci/typos' and is a mandatory check.

- doctstrings in generated files are produced from OpenStack services code.
  There is no point fixing them here and instead syntax or typos should be
  fixed upstream. The only exception is that during code generation spelling
  issues are automatically addressed by `typos -w`.

- Merge commits are forbidden. Whenever you open a PR please update it with
  rebase and not a merge commit. It is also recommended to "allow edits from
  maintainers" to help us get the quick fixes to the PR.

- PRs are merged as squash commits.

## Releasing

There are 2 projects being used to take care of release process:

- `release-plz` validates challenges and prepares PR to cut a release proposing
  the corresponding version. Merging PR will trigger `release-plz` to create
  new version, tag it, perform Rust release to <crates.io>.

- `cargo dist` builds and uploads binary artifacts to the GH releases. This is
  triggered by creating a git tag `CRATE_NAME_vMAJ.MIN.PATCH`. Part of the
  normal PR CI `cargo dist` is also building artifacts and stores them as CI
  artifacts.

Since every crate in the workspace is currently having independent versioning
it is not trivial to rely on "latest" release. This is explicitly harming
publishing binary artifacts. As of now every crate is released in a separate
tag with binary artifacts included in the corresponding release. Maybe combined
tag (i.e. in a form YYYY-MM-DD) may be produced repackaging binaries, but it is
not the case right now.
