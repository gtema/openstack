# Contributing

Thank you so much for having interesting in contributing to the project.

## Code Generation

Most parts of the code are automatically generated by
<https://opendev.org/openstack/codegenerator> and therefore direct changes to
the generated code are not making sense. Instead the codegenerator should be
adapted where necessary. This approach forces code to be consistent.

All generated modules have a corresponding notice in the header.

## Rust design decisions:

- If a function needs to take ownership of the data, pass by value

- If a function only needs to read the data, pass a reference (borrow)

- If a function needs to change the data, pass a mutable reference.
