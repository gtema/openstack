# OpenStack Terminal User Interface (TUI)

Exploring the cloud resources using CLI is not something very comfortable. A
terminal user interface improves user experience when a quick look at currently
present resources is required.

openstack_tui (`ostui` as a binary name) is such TUI built upon
[Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs) and inspired in functionality by
[k9s](https://k9scli.io) that provides TUI for Kubernetes.
