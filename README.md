# OpenStack Rust

This is a package combining SDK and CLI

- `openstack_sdk` - SDK
- `openstack_cli` - The new and shiny CLI for OpenStack
- `structable_derive` - Helper crate for having Output in some way similar to
  old OpenStackClient
- `xtask` - workflow helper
- `doc` - tiny doc of the project (does not include code documentation, this is
  something different)

## Trying out

Currently there are no releases published that can be used, therefore the only
way to try it out is to build it yourself or find somebody who can provide you
a binary. Since the project is a pure `Rust` you must be having a Rust compile suite.

```console
cargo b
```

Once the binary is available just start playing with it:

```console
osc --help
osc --os-cloud devstack compute flavor list
```

## Documentation

In the current state of the project there is not so much human written
documentation since not all interfaces are stable enough. There is however
quite some code documentation coverage (can be generated by `cargo doc`) or
once the project is being adopted by the OpenStack they are going to be
published. There is currently an additional document that is supposed to become
a document for the users places in the `doc` folder. The `osc` interface is
described part of that [`osc supported commands`](doc/src/osc.md) as an
automatically generated doc.
