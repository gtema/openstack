# OpenStack Rust

This is a package combining SDK and CLI

- `openstack_sdk` - SDK
- `openstack_cli` - The new and shiny CLI for OpenStack
- `structable_derive` - Helper crate for having Output in some way similar to old OpenStackClient
- `xtask` - workflow helper
- `doc` - tiny doc of the project (does not include code documentation, this is something different)
