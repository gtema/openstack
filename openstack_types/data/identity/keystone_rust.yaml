      description: |-
        Initiate the authentication for the given identity provider. Mapping can be passed, otherwise
        the one which is set as a default on the identity provider level is used.

        The API returns the link to the identity provider which must be open in the web browser. Once
        user authenticates in the identity provider UI a redirect to the url passed as a callback in
        the request is being done as a typical oauth2 authorization code callback. The client is
        responsible for serving this callback server and use received authorization code and state to
        exchange it for the Keystone token passing it to the `/v4/federation/oidc/callback`.

        Desired scope (OpenStack) can be also passed to get immediately scoped token after the
        authentication completes instead of the unscoped token.

        This is an unauthenticated API call. User, mapping, scope validation will happen when the
        callback is invoked.

    UserVerificationPolicy:
      type: string
      description: |
        Defines the User Authenticator Verification policy. This is documented
        https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#enumdef-userverificationrequirement, and each variant lists
        it’s effects.

        To be clear, Verification means that the Authenticator perform extra or supplementary
        interaction with the user to verify who they are. An example of this is Apple Touch Id required
        a fingerprint to be verified, or a yubico device requiring a pin in addition to a touch event.

        An example of a non-verified interaction is a yubico device with no pin where touch is the only
        interaction - we only verify a user is present, but we don’t have extra details to the
        legitimacy of that user.

        As UserVerificationPolicy is only used in credential registration, this stores the verification
        state of the credential in the persisted credential. These persisted credentials define which
        UserVerificationPolicy is issued during authentications.

        IMPORTANT - Due to limitations of the webauthn specification, CTAP devices, and browser
        implementations, the only secure choice as an RP is required.

          ⚠️ WARNING - discouraged is marked with a warning, as some authenticators will FORCE
          verification during registration but NOT during authentication. This makes it impossible
          for a relying party to consistently enforce user verification, which can confuse users and
          lead them to distrust user verification is being enforced.

          ⚠️ WARNING - preferred can lead to authentication errors in some cases due to browser
          peripheral exchange allowing authentication verification bypass. Webauthn RS is not
          vulnerable to these bypasses due to our tracking of UV during registration through
          authentication, however preferred can cause legitimate credentials to not prompt for UV
          correctly due to browser perhipheral exchange leading Webauthn RS to deny them in what
          should otherwise be legitimate operations.

    Identity providers API.

    Identity provider resource allows to federate users from an external Identity Provider (i.e.
    Keycloak, Azure AD, etc.).

    Using the Identity provider requires creation of the mapping, which describes how to map attributes
    of the remote Idp to local users.

    Identity provider with an empty domain_id are considered globals and every domain may use it with
    appropriate mapping.
- name: mappings
  description: |
    Federation mappings API.

    Mappings define how the user attributes on the remote IDP are mapped to the local user.

    Mappings with an empty domain_id are considered globals and every domain may use it. Such mappings
    require the `domain_id_claim` attribute to be set to identify the domain_id for the respective
    user.

    Token restrictions API.

    Token restrictions allow controlling multiple aspects of the authentication and authorization.

    - `allow_rescope` controls whether it is allowed to change the scope of the token. That is by default possible for normal (i.e. password) authentication, is forbidden for the application credentials and may need to be also forbidden for the JWT based authentication.

    - `allow_renew` controls whether it is possible to renew the token (get a new token from existing token). This is most likely undisired for the JWT auth.

    - `project_id` may control that this token can be only issued for the fixed project scope.

    - `user_id` may specify the fixed user_id that will be used when issuing the token independently of the authentication. This is useful for Service Accounts.

    - `roles` binds the roles of the issued token on the scope. Using this bypasses necessity to grant the roles explicitly to the user.
